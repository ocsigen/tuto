=How to send a file (download)?=

To serve file, you can use Ocsigen Server's module staticmod.
But it is also possible to ask Eliom to send files using module
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"|module Eliom_registration.File>>,
for example if you want Eliom to perform some privacy checks before sending,
or if the answer is not always a file.
