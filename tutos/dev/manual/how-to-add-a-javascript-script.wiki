=How to add a Javacript script?=

If you have client-side programs on your website, you can use Eliom's client-server features, that will compile client side parts to JS using **Ocsigen Js_of_ocaml**, and include automatically the script in the page. But in some cases you may also want to include yourselves external JS scripts.

=== Include the script on the html header

Javascript scripts are included in the header using the **js_script** function (defined in <<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_content.Html.D>>).

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Eliom_content.Html.D (* for make_uri an js_script *)

js_script
     ~uri:(make_uri (Eliom_service.static_dir ())
              ["hello.js"])
     ()
>>
This function has 2 parameters: the file path and unit.

The file path is generated using the **make_uri** function (from <<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_content.Html.D>> module). This function creates the relative URL string using the static directory (which is a service) configured in the configuration file and the given list.

Insert this piece of code on the list given in parameter to the **head** function.

Or you can use:
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"|val Eliom_tools.F.head>>

=== Call an external function

Have a look at
<<a_manual project="js_of_ocaml" chapter="bindings"|this page of Js_of_ocaml's manual>>
to understand how to call JS function from your OCaml program.
