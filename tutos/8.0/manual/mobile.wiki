= Mobile applications with Ocsigen

Since Eliom 6.0, the Ocsigen framework provides infrastructure for
building mobile applications. This enables rapid development of
Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile apps with the same APIs and
programming style as for a regular client-server Web application. In
fact, one single codebase can be used to produce all these
applications simultaneously.

The easiest way to get started with Ocsigen-based mobile development
is to use [[wiki("ocsigen-start"):|Ocsigen-start]].  Ocsigen-start is a
library and skeleton for building "minimum viable product" Web
applications with standard functionality like users, notifications,
etc. This skeleton is immediately usable as a mobile application. You
can install {{{ocsigen-start}}} via OPAM
( {{{opam install ocsigen-start}}} )
and instantiate its template with the command
{{{eliom-distillery -name ocsimobile -template os.pgocaml}}}.  For
launching the mobile application, follow the instructions in the
template's {{{README.md}}}.

== Programming style

You need to follow a certain programming style for your Eliom code to
work flawlessly inside an Ocsigen-start mobile app. This style is
described in the <<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="clientserver-services"|chapter on
client services>> from the Eliom manual. The idea is that you
implement as much of your application as possible in shared sections
({{{[%%shared ...]}}} or {{{let%shared ... = ...}}}), and that you
register handlers for your Eliom services on both the client and the
server. The Ocsigen-start template already uses the above programming
style, so refer to the files generated by {{{eliom-distillery}}} for
inspiration.

== Going further

* [[wiki("ocsigen-toolkit"):|Ocsigen-toolkit]] provides a set of user
  interface widgets that are particularly useful for mobile applications.

* Danny Willems provides a comprehensive set of
  [[https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list|OCaml
  bindings to Cordova plugins]]. These can readily be used for your
  Eliom mobile application.
