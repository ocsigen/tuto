# Generate the HTML files locally

To generate the static HTML files locally, you have to:
- Make sure to have [quickdop](https://ocsigen.org/html_of_wiki/latest/manual/intro#install) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) installed
- Run the command `make local DOC=[doc folder]` (for example `make local DOC=tutos/`)

The HTML files will then be created in the _doc/\[version\]/manual folder
