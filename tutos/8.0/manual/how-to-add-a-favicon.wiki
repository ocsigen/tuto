=How to add a Favicon?=

A favicon is a file of type "ico" which contain a picture of size 16x16px. It is the picture that you can ususally see next to the title of the page on a browser.

{{http://public.db0.fr/dev/ocsigen/favicon.png|favicon for Ocsigen.org}}

By default, all browsers look for a file {{{favicon.ico}}}
at the root of the website:
<<code| http://website.com/favicon.ico>>

Just put the file at the root of the static directory set in the configuration file.
