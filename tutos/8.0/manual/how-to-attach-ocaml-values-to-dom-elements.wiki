=How to attach OCaml values to DOM elements?=

It is often convenient to attach OCaml values to certain elements of
the page. There are several ways to achieve this.

* The first possibility is to use DATA attributes (for example if the
  page is generated on server side).
* Alternatively, you can add a new property to the element using the
  {{{##.}}} syntax.
  ** You can create a new class type with the new property
     (that can be either an OCaml value or a JS value), possibly
     inheriting from the type of the DOM element, and create an
     (unsafe) coercion function for this type; or simply
  ** Create getter and setter functions to add the new property.
