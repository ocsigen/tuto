# Generate the html files locally

To generate the static html files locally you have to :
- Make sure to have [quickdop](https://ocsigen.org/html_of_wiki/latest/manual/intro#install) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) installed
- Run the command `make local`

The html files will then be created in the _doc/\[version\]/manual folder
