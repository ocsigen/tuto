=How to write a JSON service?=

*If you want to communicate with a client side Eliom program, you do not need to serialize yourself your data to JSON. Serialization/Deserialization of any OCaml type is done automatically by Eliom. Just use OCaml services (or, simpler: server functions and call the function from your OCaml client side program).
*If you want to use your own JSON format, you need to have your own serialisation function to JSON (or for example to use some OCaml library like [[http://mjambon.com/yojson.html|yojson]] to generate JSON). In that case, you can register your service using {{{Eliom_registration.String}}} instead of {{{Eliom_registration.Html}}} (see example below). The handler function must return the JSON value as a string, and a the content-type.
*It is even possible to define yourself your own registration module, to be used instead of {{{Eliom_registration.String}}}. Thus, you can use an OCaml representation of the JSON value (and you don't call the serializer yourself). Have a look on how modules like {{{Eliom_registration.String}}} are implemented to know how to do that.

<<code language="ocaml"|

let my_json_service =
  Eliom_service.create
    ~path:(Eliom_service.Path ["my_json_service"])
    ~meth:(Eliom_service.Get Eliom_parameter.unit)
    ()

let _ =
  Eliom_registration.String.register
    ~service:my_json_service
    (fun () () ->
      Lwt.return ("{text:'something'}", "application/json"))

**Comments:** \\
If you want to get result from a Database, it could already be in JSON format. \\
Anyway, you probably do not need to pretty-print JSON yourself. \\
