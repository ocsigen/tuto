=How to call a server-side function from client-side?=

It is possible to call server-side functions in client-side.
For security reasons, these functions must first
be declared explicitely as RPCs (with the type of their
argument).

<<code language="ocaml" class="shared"|
let%rpc f (x : int) : string Lwt.t = ...
...
>>
<<code language="ocaml" class="client"|
[%client ... f 4 ... ]
>>

The syntax is provided by opam package {{{ocsigen-ppx-rpc}}}.

The server-side function ({{{f}}} in the example) needs to return a
Lwt value.

Server functions are just syntactic sugar for pathless services
returning OCaml values.

Note that you need to install {{{ppx_deriving}}}, and load our JSON
{{{ppx_deriving}}} plugin in your project. The plugin is available as
the Ocamlfind package {{{js_of_ocaml.deriving.ppx}}}.

If the function takes a more complex type, this type must have been
declared with {{{ppx_deriving}}}. For example,

<<code language="ocaml"|
type t = int * string [@@deriving json]
>>

Our infrastructure provides server-side data validation of the data
sent, and prevents malformed data from crashing the server.
