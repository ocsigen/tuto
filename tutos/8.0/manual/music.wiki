<<concepts |Persistence of the client application>>

We will add an audio player to the page that will stay when page
changes. This emphasises the fact that browsing inside an application
does not stop the client side code: the music keeps playing when the
content of the page and the url change.

We first create the player node at toplevel.
<<code language="ocaml"|
let player =
  Eliom_content.Html.Id.create_global_elt
    (audio
       ~srcs:(make_uri (Eliom_service.static_dir ())
                  ["music.ogg"],
              [])
       ~a:[a_autoplay (`Autoplay);a_controls (`Controls)]
       [txt "Your browser does not support audio element" ])
>>

And we insert the player in the page.

And that's all! Since the {{{player}}} node is declared unique, no new
player is created when the page changed: this is exact same node.

<<wip | In fact browsers stop the player as soon as the dom
element is manipulated. That happens when we change the page: to
continue playing the player should not be present as an element of the
page>>

To run this example, you will need to add an ogg file in the static directory.
