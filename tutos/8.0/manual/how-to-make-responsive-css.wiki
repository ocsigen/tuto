=How to make reponsive CSS with ocsigen?=

The best way to do that is to make one general css sheet plus three css sheets, small, medium and large screen using media queries, a feature introduced in CSS3.

Write theses lines in your css sheets:

<<code language="css"|
@media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 481px) and (max-device-width: 768px)
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 769px)
