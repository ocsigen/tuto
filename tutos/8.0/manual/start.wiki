This tutorial describes how to get started with Ocsigen
quickly. Thanks to an application template provided by the Ocsigen
team, you will get to a working application with standard
functionality like users and notifications in only a few minutes. This
template can be used for learning purposes, or even as a starting
point for your own product.

The template you will use comes from [[wiki("ocsigen-start"):|Ocsigen Start]].
Ocsigen Start provides a complete mechanism for adding and managing
users, including activation links and password reset. It additionally
contains a module for displaying tips, a module for sending
notifications to your users, and other utilities typically needed in
modern Web applications.

The template comes with a default style (developed with
SASS) that follows modern Web practices, e.g., it is responsive and
thus mobile-friendly. Of course, you are free to modify the style to
match your own brand or personality.

The template is multi-platform. This means that it can run on a Web
browser or as a mobile app for Android, iOS, or Windows.

== Installation

Install the dependencies ({{{postgresql}}} and one of {{{sass}}}, {{{sassc}}}).
On Debian-based systems:
{{{
apt install postgresql ruby-sass
}}}

Install Ocsigen Start and all its OCaml dependencies using OPAM:
{{{
opam install ocsigen-start
}}}

Create your application using Eliom distillery:
{{{
eliom-distillery -name myapp -template os.pgocaml
}}}

Have a look at the
[[https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigen-start/blob/master/template.distillery/README.md|README]]
file to learn how to compile it
and, possibly, to generate the mobile applications.

== I installed it and compiled it, what next?

It is now time to learn Ocsigen! The template is a great way to get
started, because it comes with multiple runnable examples that show
you:

* How to do remote procedure calls (RPCs);
* How to save session data (in //Eliom references//);
* How to use the notification system;
* How to create reactive pages;
* Many examples of widgets from [[wiki("ocsigen-toolkit"):|Ocsigen Toolkit]]:
** Carousel
** Pages with several tabs
** Time and date pickers
* ...

The corresponding files are well-commented, so you can quickly find
out how things work.
