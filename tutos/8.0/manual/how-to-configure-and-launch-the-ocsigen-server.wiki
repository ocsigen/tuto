=How to configure and launch the Ocsigen Server?=

=== Default configuration file

* Eliom distillery is generating a configuration file
* If you want to create it yourself, you can have a look at the default configuration file provided with the installation of Ocsigen (usually {{{/etc/ocsigenserver/ocsigenserver.conf.sample}}}).
* Change the port by the network port number you want your website to work on. The port **80** is the port used by http by default but you need to be the administrator of your server to use it.
* Adapt paths.
* Change other parameters that suit your needs using the <<a_manual project="ocsigenserver" chapter="config"|configuration file documentation>>.

=== Your own configuration file

Have a look at the <<a_manual project="ocsigenserver" chapter="config"|configuration file full documentation>>.

=== Launch the server
